# OpenCVPy
OpenCVPy is just a collection of samples and tutorials of OpenCV with Python based on the python courses from [this website](https://pythonprogramming.net/loading-images-python-opencv-tutorial/).

OpenCV is an image processing library that allows for modification functionality with images as well as videos and webcam.

### Quick Start and Setup

Obviously the main thing needed in these tutorials is opencv(cv2) and numpy(numpy) libraries for python.
Matplotlib is optional but not required.

There are two methods to setting up

Method 1 (Easier and Preferred)
- Download Anaconda: Anaconda contains spyder a nice ide for python that includes many of the import libraries you need
- https://www.continuum.io/downloads
- However, Opencv will not be included so please follow these instructions in the link below:
- http://mathalope.co.uk/2015/05/07/opencv-python-how-to-install-opencv-python-package-to-anaconda-windows/
- add opencv to your path

Method 2
- Make sure you have the python IDLE: (preferably 2.7)
- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- pip install numpy
- pip install matplotlib
- download the wheel for the opencv library here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv
